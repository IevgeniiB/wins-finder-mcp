## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager (`pip install uv`)

### Option 1: uvx (Recommended - when published)

```bash
# Install and run directly from PyPI (coming soon)
uvx wins-finder-mcp

# Or run with specific Python version
uvx --python 3.13 wins-finder-mcp
```

### Option 2: Development/Local Installation

```bash
# Clone and set up the project
git clone https://github.com/IevgeniiB/wins-finder-mcp.git
cd wins-finder-mcp

# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
uv venv --python 3.13
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -e .

# Run the MCP server
python -m wins_finder
```

### Option 3: Development Mode

```bash
# Install with development dependencies
uv pip install -e .[dev]

# Verify installation with tests
pytest

# Run with coverage reporting
pytest --cov-report=html
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### 1. Essential Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file or set environment variables:

```bash
# Required for basic functionality
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_github_token_here

# Optional but recommended for intelligent correlation analysis  
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-your_openrouter_key_here

# Optional service integrations
LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_your_linear_token_here
NOTION_API_KEY=secret_your_notion_integration_token
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url
```

### 2. GitHub Token Setup

**Fine-Grained Personal Access Token (Recommended)**:
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new
2. Repository permissions needed:
   - ‚úÖ **Contents**: Read (commits and repository data)
   - ‚úÖ **Pull requests**: Read (PRs, reviews, comments)
   - ‚úÖ **Issues**: Read (issue comments and interactions)
   - ‚úÖ **Actions**: Read (workflow insights)
   - ‚úÖ **Metadata**: Read (basic repository info)
3. Account permissions:
   - ‚úÖ **Profile**: Read (user profile information)

**Classic Token Alternative**: Use `repo` and `read:user` scopes

### 3. OpenRouter Setup (Optional but Recommended)

For intelligent analysis and cross-service correlation:
1. Sign up at https://openrouter.ai  
2. Create an API key
3. Recommended models: **Claude-3.5-Sonnet** or **GPT-4o**
4. **Fallback**: System works without LLM using heuristic analysis

### 4. Test Your Configuration

```bash
# After setting environment variables, test all connections
python -c \"
import os
from wins_finder.mcp.server import test_authentication
print(test_authentication())
\"
```
