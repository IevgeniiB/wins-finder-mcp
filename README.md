# üèÜ Wins Finder MCP Agent

An intelligent MCP (Model Context Protocol) agent that analyzes your work activity across GitHub, Linear, Notion, and Slack to generate context-aware weekly accomplishment reports for performance reviews, 1:1s, and self-reflection.

## üéØ Who Is This For?

- **Software engineers** preparing for performance reviews
- **Engineering managers** tracking team contributions
- **Individual contributors** wanting better visibility into their impact
- **Remote workers** needing to articulate cross-platform achievements
- **Anyone** who struggles to remember and articulate weekly accomplishments

## ‚ú® What Makes This Special?

- **Cross-Service Intelligence**: Correlates activities across platforms (GitHub PR + Linear issue + Notion docs = feature delivery)
- **Context-Aware Reports**: Adapts tone and focus based on audience (manager vs peer vs self-reflection)
- **LLM-Powered Analysis**: Uses AI to find meaningful patterns and connections
- **Evidence-Backed Claims**: All accomplishments include links to supporting activities
- **Smart Caching**: Avoids API rate limits with intelligent data caching

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Pull and run the container
docker run -it --rm \
  -e GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token \
  -e OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key \
  ghcr.io/yourusername/wins-finder-mcp:latest

# Or with docker compose
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/wins-finder-mcp/main/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up
```

### Option 2: Python/uv (Development)

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wins-finder-mcp.git
cd wins-finder-mcp

# Create virtual environment and install
uv venv --python 3.13
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml

# Run the server
python -m wins_finder
```

### Option 3: uvx (Recommended for Easy Use)

```bash
# Run directly without installation (when published to PyPI)
uvx wins-finder-mcp

# Or run from source
uvx --from . wins-finder

# Specify Python version
uvx --python 3.13 wins-finder-mcp
```

### Option 4: pip (System-wide)

```bash
# Install from PyPI (when published)
pip install wins-finder-mcp

# Run the server
wins-finder
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### 1. GitHub Personal Access Token

#### Option A: Fine-Grained Personal Access Token (Recommended)

Create a token at https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new

**Repository Permissions:**
- ‚úÖ `Actions`: Read (for workflow data)
- ‚úÖ `Contents`: Read (for repository contents and commits)  
- ‚úÖ `Issues`: Read (for issue comments and interactions)
- ‚úÖ `Metadata`: Read (for basic repository info)
- ‚úÖ `Pull requests`: Read (for PRs, reviews, comments)

**Account Permissions:**
- ‚úÖ `Profile`: Read (for user profile information)

**Organization Permissions (if analyzing org repos):**
- ‚úÖ `Members`: Read (for organization membership info)

#### Option B: Classic Personal Access Token

Create a token at https://github.com/settings/tokens with these scopes:
- `repo` - Full repository access
- `read:user` - Read user profile
- `read:org` - Read organization membership

> **Note**: Fine-grained tokens are more secure as they can be limited to specific repositories and have more granular permissions.

### 2. OpenRouter API Key (Optional)

For intelligent correlation analysis:
1. Sign up at https://openrouter.ai
2. Create an API key
3. Recommended models: Claude-3.5-Sonnet or GPT-4

### 3. Test Configuration

Once your MCP client connects to the server, use the `test_authentication` tool to verify all environment variables are properly configured.

### 4. Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_github_token_here

# Optional but recommended for intelligent analysis
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-your_openrouter_key_here

# Optional service configurations
LINEAR_API_KEY=your_linear_token
NOTION_API_KEY=your_notion_integration_token
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url

# GitHub API Rate Limiting Configuration (Optional)
GITHUB_PR_LIMIT=50              # Maximum pull requests to fetch (default: 50)
GITHUB_REPO_LIMIT=10            # Maximum repositories to analyze (default: 10)
GITHUB_COMMIT_LIMIT=20          # Maximum commits per repository (default: 20)
GITHUB_REVIEW_LIMIT=30          # Maximum reviews to fetch (default: 30)  
GITHUB_COMMENT_LIMIT=20         # Maximum issue comments to fetch (default: 20)
```

**GitHub Rate Limiting Notes:**
- These limits help avoid hitting GitHub API rate limits while still providing comprehensive analysis
- Adjust higher for more thorough analysis, lower for faster performance
- GitHub's default rate limit is 5000 requests/hour for authenticated users
- These settings balance thoroughness with API efficiency
